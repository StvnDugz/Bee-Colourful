## Description

In this simple, challenging mini game, you control a bee who changes colours and can fly left or right. Your objective is to fly into oncoming flowers that match your colour to earn points, and avoid the ones that don't.

## Design Choices

- Accessibility - playable on one hand. 

- Quick to learn - repetitive and rhythmic gameplay gives it an almost meditative quality.

- Bright uplifting colours - it can be helpful to concentrate on colours that evoke pleasant emotions.

- Match the colours - testing your recall is an excellent distraction technique when your mind and heart are racing.
