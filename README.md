## Design Choices

- Accessibility - playable on one hand. 

- Quick to learn - repetitive and rhythmic gameplay gives it an almost meditative quality.

- Bright uplifting colours - it can be helpful to concentrate on colours that evoke pleasant emotions.

- Match the colours - testing your recall is an excellent distraction technique when your mind and heart are racing.
